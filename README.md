### About me
Hello I am Arturo, I am a graduate student at the University of San Francisco. I am currently doing my Master studies in Data Science.

### Project Description
This repository is a guided project from the MIT online course that I took a few months back. The main objective of it is to find a way to predict the value of used cars given certain features.

### Additional info
Unfortunatley, I do not have access to the data the Jupyet notebook referes to. Nevertheless, the project helped me get more familiar with linear regression as a tool for predictive analysis.
